        <p class="best-des-p">Serene shrines, spectacular skyscrapers and the best street food on the planet are all waiting for you in Bangkok. But outside the capital, there is island fun on Phuket, or head north for hill tribes and heavenly hikes. Here is our pick of the most popular places to visit in Thailand, big and small.</p>

        <h2 class="chiang-mai">Chiang mai</h2>
        <p class="ch-p">gives Bangkok a run for its money, with mad whirl of culture and nature. You won't run out of religious shrines there are more than 500 temples to admire. Meanwhile, for kids, and adults, too, there's Chiang Mai Night Zoo. If you want to stretch a leg, try hiking in lush jungles and rafting along boiling-white rivers. At Thailand's highest point, Doi Inthanon, you'll get to meet ethnic hill tribes, witness a world of spectacular waterfalls and feed watermelons and bananas to magnificent elephants at an ethical sanctuary. Unlike Bangkok, the nightlife here is low-key, but don't take that as an indication to stay indoors once the sun goes down. There are plenty of bars to unwind in, and if you're itching to stock up on brightly coloured Thai pots, bags and shirts to gift the folks back home, the night bazaar has your name written all over it.</p>

        <h2 class="bangkok">Bangkok</h2>
        <p class="bkk-p">Neon-frantic and temple-tranquil, the Thai capital is simply unmissable, with stacks of things to see and do however you fancy spending your time. Delivering reams of cultural and historic sights, BKK also flaunts a modern side with muscular skyscrapers and myriad outbreaks of modern architecture, fabulous art galleries, and fascinating museums. When you want to spend, the city is ready to sell: in frenetic markets (among them the floating variety for which the Thai capital is such a hit) as well as mega malls, and the dining scene is a spin, from gourmet restaurants to street food. After dark things are as buzzing, with pulsating nightclubs, live music, cocktail bars, incredible rooftop bars and adrenaline-laced Muay Thai fights. Getting around is easy, thanks to the BTS sky train, MRT subway, numerous buses, taxis, and tuk tuks. Perhaps best of all, you'll find accommodation to suit you whatever your bag and your budget.</p>

        <h2 class="phuket">Phuket</h2>
        <p class="phu-p">Thailand's largest island and one of the best-loved and most-visited in the country, Phuket has many faces. First-timers often head to the thronging sands of Patong, on the west coast, known for its no-holds-barred nightlife and watersports. Beyond, though, there are beaches to suit everyone. Catch a boat to the scenic Freedom Beach, switch off on Karon Beach, drink in the views from Kathu Beach, and prepare for plenty more. Promthep Cape is the place to head for liquid-lovely sunsets. After dark, the entertainment cranks into life: there a world-class shows and exhilarating Muay Thai fights; food is, without exception, delicious, from the smart restaurants of Phuket Town to the simple, sizzling seafood turned out at street and night markets. Hiking, go karting, ethical elephant encounters, fishing, snorkelling, and jet skiing are just a few activities to try, and Wat Chalong, along with the Big Buddha, are two of the most popular cultural sites. Don't bypass Phuket Town the ornate old neoclassical buildings and luridly painted shophouses are beautiful. For fun and giggles, Baan Teelanka (the Upside Down House) and Phuket Trickeye Museum are the biz.</p>

        <h2 class="ayutthaya">Ayutthaya</h2>
        <p class="ayu-p">Even if you hate the idea history on holiday, this place will convert you: easily reached from Bangkok, the Unesco-listed Ayutthaya is one of Thailand's sublime ancient cities. Evocative ruins take you on a journey back in time to Siam's golden age. Wat Yai Chai Mongkorn is particularly photogenic, with tall stupas that you are permitted to climb, surrounded by rows of Buddha statues swathed in saffron tones. You'll want to make a date with Wat Mahathat, where the famous stone Buddha head peers out from the infinite roots of a banyan tree growing around it. See, too, Wat Ratchaburana and Wat Si Samphet. The old Dutch and Portuguese areas are well worth a visit and the floating market is a great place to pick up souvenirs. A hired bicycle or, if you're an experienced rider, a scooter is the only way to appreciate Ayutthaya. That said, tuk-tuks amass on every corner.</p>

        <h2 class="krabi">Krabi</h2>
        <p class="kra-p">One of Southern Thailand's most popular provinces, Krabi can't fail to seduce: it has life-changing experiences for tourists both on the mainland and on its islands. Koh Phi Phi is often said to be one of Thailand's most picturesque islands; check out Maya Bay and Phi Phi Viewpoint to see why. Koh Lanta is a more laid-back affair, with long, sandy beaches, chilled-out beach bars, mangroves and a Moken (sea gypsy) community. Animal lover? You'll want to volunteer at Lanta Animal Welfare, not just for the feel-good factor but to help make a difference. Koh Jum and Koh Rok are a couple of the province's smaller and lesser-visited island favorites. On the mainland, Railay is a rock climber's paradise, Ao Nang is a bustling beach resort, and Krabi Town has an engaging local-Thai vibe.</p>
